I love working with all things DevOps, from automation and software engineering
to full-on [platform engineering](https://circleci.com/blog/what-is-platform-engineering/).
I'm a huge advocate for making things self-service and as reproducible as
possible (hence my love/hate relationship with [Nix](https://nixos.org)).

Recently, I've been learning how to build developer-focal automation, building
up understanding of how to view both sides of the infrastructure coin;
platform administration and developers.

I think pineapple on pizza is a crime, I listen to everything from rock and
indie to jungle and breakcore, and I'm a huge fan of virtual reality.

I'm based in Sheffield, in the UK, and I'm always open to having conversations
with people about any topic you think I'd find interesting.
